## Background

Data Science Without Borders (DSWB) is an international initiative, funded by the Wellcome Trust and led by the African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC). This project has three overarching objectives: to strengthen data systems in Pathfinder countries, to create a sustainable environment for collaborative AI/ML platforms, and to create a user-friendly platform for AI and Machine Learning (AI/ML) tools. The impact of inequality in data availability and access is evident, particularly in resource-limited settings like many African nations. This African institution-led initiative will leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) to bridge existing gaps in data accessibility, infrastructure, and expertise. It aims to foster a collaborative environment that empowers African nations to harness the full potential of AI/ML for improving health outcomes. 

We would be working with three Pathfinder Institutions:

 - the Armauer Hansen Research Institute (AHRI) in Ethiopia ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¹
 - the Institute for Health Research, Epidemiological Surveillance (IRESSEF) in Senegal ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡³
 - and the Training and Douala General Hospital (DGH) in Cameroon ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡²

The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and the Committee on Data of the International Science Council (CODATA) collaborate as delivery partners providing support in platform development. The Africa CDC provides key technical oversight for the project, supporting country engagement, identification of priority use cases and provision of guidance for effective policy engagement. 

This project will host the **Platforms and Data Harmonization Working Group** from **2024 to 2025**.
